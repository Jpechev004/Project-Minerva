# Project-Minerva
Budgeting website

Welcome to Minerva, this is my first project.
I will be going through the FreeCodeCamp bootcamp while I code this project.

The purpose of the website is to create a budgeting website, where you can input your income and expenses to see how much you should be able to spend, save and/or invest.
This is aso the first time that I use Github to save a project.
